        <p>As you already know, my name is Joshua, i am from Long island, NY and have lived there my entire life. 
            Long island is nice but fairly boring it really is just regular subarbs but 40 minutes to NYC and it has beaches.

            All my life i have been good with computers so i decided to pursue computer science in college. 
            Outside of college i volunteer at my fire department as an EMT (yeah i know it doesnt make sense) i do this because i also like the medical field but decided to try this because i already do that. 
            At home i have two dogs Pixie (the big one) and Rico (rescued from Puerto Rico). She is seven and he is almost five.

            Also because i know you like cats, we found a litter in my backyard a couple years back and one of them was abandoned so my sisters boyfriend took him in and his name is Remy.
